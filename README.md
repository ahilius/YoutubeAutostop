# Youtube Autostop

Chrome extension that loads youtube videos in the unstarted/unloaded state.

## Issues

* My version seems to stop videos slightly slower that AutoplayStopper, something to do with when the javascript injection code is run, which I didn't really understand.

* When a video is clicked and youtube doesn't actually load a new page, instead just replaces the dom, the video won't be stopped.

Code copied from [AutoplayStopper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autoplaystopper/ejddcgojdblidajhngkogefpkknnebdh), which works on many other video sites and not just youtube. I just preferred extensions that work on specific sites.
